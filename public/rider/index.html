            <h1>This is my speaker rider, if you'd like me to speak at your event it's important you read it.</h1>
            <a href="/">&larr; Home</a>

            <p class="colophon">This idea (and the text of this page) was inspired by <a href="https://twitter.com/rem">@rem</a> and his <a href="https://remysharp.com/rider">rider</a>, he was originally inspired by <a href="https://twitter.com/sehurlburt/status/899400986791354368">Stephanie Hurlburt's tweet-form rider</a></p>

            <h2>Huh?</h2>

            <p>I'm very honoured you've decided to invite me to your event and I want all conferences and events to be welcoming to all. So with that in mind, this is my speaker and inclusivity rider. It's a constant work in progress, and I understand smaller meetups and community events may not be able to meet all requirements. However, this rider does apply to all commercial conferences.</p>

            <h2>The rider</h2>

            <ol>
                <li><strong>Code of Conduct</strong>: There is public Code of Conduct linked available on your conference pages.</li>
                <li><strong>Speaker Diversity</strong>: as a white cis man, I count as "another white dude" at your event, and I want to see conferences showing off the truly diverse world we live in. The event will have at least 40%✻ non white-cis-men speaking†.</li>
                <li><strong>Costs covered</strong>: travel and lodging for all speakers is covered. Please note that I will not fly economy for long haul flights.</li>
            </ol>

            <p><small>✻ I hope to see this number increase in time.<br/>† That's to say: people who are "not like me".</small></p>

            <p>These requirements are important to me because I'm in a position in my career that I can help towards making conferences more positive and safe in this small way. A full line up of white men at an event is not something I can be part of any more and I want to be part of positive change in our industry.</p>
