            <h1>About</h1>
            <a href="/">&larr; Home</a>

            <p>Hi! I'm Joe. My <a href="http://gwendolynfaker.com" title="GwendolynFaker.com>">wife</a> and I live in London with our cat <a href="/about/zelda.jpg" title="A picture of Zelda">Zelda</a>. I'm in my mid-thirties (eww). I'm a dual Swedish/British national, which means that on one side I love hockey and have an uncanny ability with flat-pack furniture and on the other, I never perform adequately at international football tournaments.</p>

            <p>I've been working with technology for a long time, a lot with the web (building stuff for it and building stuff that powers it), machine intelligence (ü§ñ) and distributed systems. It's been the most amazing, fulfilling thing I could have done professionally, but it's also <a href="/diversity/" title="we suck at inclusion">profoundly broken</a>.</p>

            <p>I work at <a href="https://permutive.com">Permutive</a> (‚ù§Ô∏è) where I have the huge pleasure of being VP Engineering. I've worked at lots of <a href="https://uk.linkedin.com/in/joe8bit" title="LinkedIn link (ewwwwwww)">other places</a> too. I have a few patents, have spoken at quite a few conferences and I've been known to write books.</p>

            <p>I'm professionally passionate about <a href="https://github.com/Joe8Bit">open source</a>, building inclusive teams and being an advocate for Wheaton's Law. I'm personally passionate about travel (a clich√©, but true), the art of Caravaggio (chiaroscuro is my jam), sneakers (despite taking so many L's), mechanical keyboards (another clich√©), the 1994 movie Hackers and being an advocate for Wheaton's Law.</p>

            <p>Outside of the day-job, I: <a href="https://havantpark.com">invest in and advise</a> start-ups; <a href="https://teachdigital.io">co-founded a non-profit</a> to better the 'digital' education we give our children; and am currently starting an organisation that enables young offenders and gang members in London to reform their lives.</p>

            <p>I'm available to chat about pretty much anything via email or on most social media networks as @Joe8Bit (I picked a 'personal brand' and god dammit I'm sticking to it).</p>

            <p>You can find me on <a href="https://twitter.com/Joe8Bit">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Joe8Bit">Github</a>, <a href="https://keybase.io/Joe8Bit">Keybase</a>, <a href="https://uk.linkedin.com/in/joe8bit">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="https://500px.com/Joe8Bit">500px</a>, <a href="https://instagram.com/Joe8Bit">Instagram</a>, <a href="https://joe8bit.wordpress.com">Wordpress</a> and most other places as @Joe8Bit. If you want to say hello, you can also send me an <a href="mailto:joe8bit@gmail.com">email</a></p>
